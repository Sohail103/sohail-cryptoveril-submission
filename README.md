# sohail-cryptoveril-submission

Submission for cryptoveril.

Files `stage1.v`, `stage2.v`, `stage3.v` contain code for the individual stages of the question.

`cryptoveril.v` is the top level module

`cryptoveril-testbench.v` is the test bench - to check with different inputs, change the values of input_data and key_bits. The clock speeds are already set with clk1 being the fastest, clk2 being 1/3rd the speed of clk1 and clk3 being 1/3rd the speed of clk2.

the folder `simulation-output` contains screenshots of waveforms from different test cases and the `.vcd` files for each of the cases. I have only attached screenshots for cases 1, 6 and 8.
